Part of achieving this goal is ensuring that users can continue to use WeChat safely and that WeChat is used in an acceptable manner by all users. This Policy sets out rules to ensure good behaviour in the use of WeChat by users.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We are guided by continuous feedback from users and industry experts in developing this Policy, and we strive to ensure that this Policy is inclusive of diverse ideas, views and information. We are always open to receiving feedback from our users – if you wish to do so, please contact us using the details at the end of this Policy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;1.2.  &#60;strong&#62;Enforcement and breach (or potential breach) of this Policy&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Where you have (or we reasonably believe you have) breached this Policy, we may, at our discretion, do any or all of the following:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;ul&#62;&#60;li&#62;a.

In addition, the laws applicable to WeChat are constantly evolving, so please remain alert to changes of laws and rules applicable to users in other jurisdictions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you wish to report another user who may have potentially breached this policy, please refer to Section 12 of this Policy for our contact details.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;1.3.  &#60;strong&#62;How do we apply this Policy?&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We will act reasonably in applying this Policy and considering whether any content or behaviour breach this Policy.

This needs to be balanced against our aim of applying this Policy fairly and consistently for all users internationally.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Therefore, in some circumstances, we may entirely prohibit the sale or distribution of certain items. In other circumstances, we may permit such sale or distribution, subject to certain restrictions as issued by us (e.g., age or geographical limit).
