Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide and the arbitrator&#38;#39;s decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity are not allowed, and nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties. These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the AAA&#38;#39;s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules. You and we must file in arbitration any claim or dispute (except intellectual property disputes) within one year from when it first could be filed. If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then those parts won&#38;#39;t be arbitrated but will proceed in court, with the rest proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of these provisions regarding arbitration is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed but the rest of these provisions regarding arbitration still apply.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you are a California resident, then (except to the extent prohibited by applicable laws) you agree to waive California Civil Code Section 1542, and any similar provision in any other jurisdiction (if you are a resident of such other jurisdiction), which states: &#38;quot;A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party”.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3 id=&#34;wechat-terms-of-service-australia-specific-terms&#34;&#62;WECHAT TERMS OF SERVICE (AUSTRALIA-SPECIFIC TERMS)&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;If you are a user of WeChat in Australia, the below Additional Terms: (a) are incorporated into these Terms; (b) apply to your use of WeChat; and (c) override the head terms of these Terms to the extent of any inconsistency.&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;All express or implied guarantees, warranties, representations, or other terms and conditions relating to these Terms or their subject matter, not contained in these Terms, are excluded from these Terms to the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts or modifies any guarantee, warranty, term or condition, right or remedy implied or imposed by any applicable laws and regulations which cannot lawfully be excluded, restricted or modified.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If any guarantee, condition, warranty or term is implied or imposed by any applicable laws and regulations and cannot be excluded (a “&#60;strong&#62;Non-Excludable Provision&#60;/strong&#62;”), and we are able to limit your remedy for a breach of the Non-Excludable Provision, then our liability for breach of the Non-Excludable Provision is limited to one or more of the following at our option:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;ul&#62;&#60;li&#62;in the case of goods, the replacement of the goods or the supply of equivalent goods, the repair of the goods, the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of acquiring equivalent goods, or the payment of the cost of having the goods repaired; or&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;in the case of services, the supplying of the services again, or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ul&#62;&#60;h3 id=&#34;wechat-terms-of-service-united-kingdom-and-european-union-specific-terms&#34;&#62;WECHAT TERMS OF SERVICE (UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPEAN UNION-SPECIFIC TERMS)&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;If you are a user of WeChat and located in the United Kingdom or European Union, the below Additional Terms: (a) are incorporated into these Terms; (b) apply to your use of WeChat; and (c) override the head terms of these Terms to the extent of any inconsistency.&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Refund of your purchases&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you have purchased and paid for a WeChat product or service provided by us (and not by any third parties), you may receive a refund for such purchase if we receive a refund request from you within 14 days from the date you completed the relevant purchase.
