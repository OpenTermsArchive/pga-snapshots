We may take action to ensure the Third-Party Content complies with our policies, or if it is considered to have violated our policies, we may remove or refuse to make available or link to it. This may be, for example, if the Third-Party Content is considered by us, or is alleged, to infringe intellectual property rights, is determined to be obscene, defamatory or abusive, if it violates any rights, or if it poses any risk to the security or performance of WeChat.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;You should remain vigilant when accessing, using or consuming Third-Party Content. We cannot review all Third-Party Content prior to it being posted, so if you believe any Third-Party Content is inaccurate, misleading, defamatory, offensive or unlawful please let us know immediately. Please also remember that Third-Party Content, as well as any other information or content accessible via WeChat that is not posted by you, may be owned by a third party, and just because you have accessed content on WeChat does not mean you have any rights in or to any such content. You should always respect the rights of others when using WeChat – if you would like to use content in a particular way you should always seek permission from the relevant rights holder.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The WeChat platform also provides access to a variety of third party products and services – such as Mini Programs made available on the Weixin Mini Programs Platform; Official Accounts; websites provided, made available, advertised or linked through WeChat (including any of WeChat&#38;#39;s associated platforms or services); and other products and services offered or advertised by third parties. These products, services and websites are operated by third parties, so we are unable to guarantee their quality, reliability or suitability. If you use or interact with these third party offerings then you should direct any questions, complaints or queries to the relevant third party who operates that offering, as we bear no responsibility for your use of those offerings, or any relationship you may enter into with any such third parties (including any payment obligations or fees that you may incur in your use of such third party offerings).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Offerings made available by third parties, or Third-Party Content, may also be subject to further terms from that third party – for example, terms from the relevant third party that originally produced or created such content or service, terms in relation to promotional activities being held on WeChat, terms relating to your use of third party-provided WeChat login functionality, or terms governing your use of any Mini Programs provided by a third party. You are solely responsible for reviewing and complying with any such third party terms and conditions.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We have the right to remove, at our sole discretion and without notice to you, any content, programs and/or services that are made available within WeChat (including any of WeChat&#38;#39;s associated platforms or services), in accordance with these Terms.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a name=&#34;Interoperability_with_Weixin&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62;&#60;em&#62;Interoperability with Weixin&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;WeChat is interoperable with Weixin, such that you are able to communicate with Weixin users and view each other&#38;#39;s Moments and Status in accordance with the applicable terms.

Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide and the arbitrator&#38;#39;s decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity are not allowed, and nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties. These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the AAA&#38;#39;s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules. You and we must file in arbitration any claim or dispute (except intellectual property disputes) within one year from when it first could be filed. If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then those parts won&#38;#39;t be arbitrated but will proceed in court, with the rest proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of these provisions regarding arbitration is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed but the rest of these provisions regarding arbitration still apply.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you are a California resident, then (except to the extent prohibited by applicable laws) you agree to waive California Civil Code Section 1542, and any similar provision in any other jurisdiction (if you are a resident of such other jurisdiction), which states: &#38;quot;A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party”.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3 id=&#34;wechat-terms-of-service-australia-specific-terms&#34;&#62;WECHAT TERMS OF SERVICE (AUSTRALIA-SPECIFIC TERMS)&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;If you are a user of WeChat in Australia, the below Additional Terms: (a) are incorporated into these Terms; (b) apply to your use of WeChat; and (c) override the head terms of these Terms to the extent of any inconsistency.&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;All express or implied guarantees, warranties, representations, or other terms and conditions relating to these Terms or their subject matter, not contained in these Terms, are excluded from these Terms to the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts or modifies any guarantee, warranty, term or condition, right or remedy implied or imposed by any applicable laws and regulations which cannot lawfully be excluded, restricted or modified.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If any guarantee, condition, warranty or term is implied or imposed by any applicable laws and regulations and cannot be excluded (a “&#60;strong&#62;Non-Excludable Provision&#60;/strong&#62;”), and we are able to limit your remedy for a breach of the Non-Excludable Provision, then our liability for breach of the Non-Excludable Provision is limited to one or more of the following at our option:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;ul&#62;&#60;li&#62;in the case of goods, the replacement of the goods or the supply of equivalent goods, the repair of the goods, the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of acquiring equivalent goods, or the payment of the cost of having the goods repaired; or&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;in the case of services, the supplying of the services again, or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ul&#62;&#60;h3 id=&#34;wechat-terms-of-service-united-kingdom-and-european-union-specific-terms&#34;&#62;WECHAT TERMS OF SERVICE (UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPEAN UNION-SPECIFIC TERMS)&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;If you are a user of WeChat and located in the United Kingdom or European Union, the below Additional Terms: (a) are incorporated into these Terms; (b) apply to your use of WeChat; and (c) override the head terms of these Terms to the extent of any inconsistency.&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Refund of your purchases&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you have purchased and paid for a WeChat product or service provided by us (and not by any third parties), you may receive a refund for such purchase if we receive a refund request from you within 14 days from the date you completed the relevant purchase.
