Ltd.</strong></td><td>10 Anson Road, #21-07 International Plaza, Singapore 079903</td></tr><tr><td>If the international dialling code of the phone number linked to your account is in United Kingdom, European Economic Area or Switzerland (“<strong>UK, EEA or Switzerland</strong>”)</td><td><strong>Tencent International Services Europe BV</strong></td><td>Buitenveldertselaan 1-5, 1082 VA Amsterdam, the Netherlands</td></tr></tbody></table><p>(in each case, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>” and “<strong>us</strong>”).</p><p>We may specify in certain of our WeChat service-specific terms that you are contracting with one of our affiliate companies (instead of <strong>WeChat International Pte. Ltd.</strong> or <strong>Tencent International Services Europe BV</strong>, as applicable) in relation to your use of the relevant WeChat service or feature to which the relevant service-specific terms apply. Where this is the case, the relevant contracting entity will be identified in the relevant WeChat service-specific terms. These Terms (including those relevant service-specific terms) will apply between you and that identified contracting entity in relation to your use of the relevant WeChat service or feature. Please review these Terms and our policies and instructions to understand how you can and cannot use WeChat. You must comply with these Terms in your use of WeChat and only use WeChat as permitted by applicable laws and regulations, wherever you may be when you use them. In some countries, there are restrictions on your use of WeChat – it is your responsibility to ensure that you are legally allowed to use WeChat where you are located, and certain WeChat functionalities may not be available in some countries.</p><p><strong>By using WeChat, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use WeChat.</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>These Terms contain provisions governing how claims can be brought between you and us (see Section 18 and Schedules 1 and 3 of the Addendum below). If you are a WeChat user residing in the United States, Schedule 1 of the Addendum below, entitled “United States-Specific Terms,” requires you to resolve all disputes with us on an individual basis and, with limited exceptions, through final and binding arbitration, <em>rather than in court. Schedule 1 of the Addendum also explains how you can opt out of this arbitration agreement in some circumstances.</em> Please read these provisions carefully.</strong></p></blockquote><p><em>Other Users</em></p><p><strong>These Terms only apply to you if you are a WeChat user, meaning that you have registered by linking a mobile number that uses international dialling codes other than +86 (a “non-China Mainland mobile number”).</strong></p><p><strong>These Terms do not apply to you if you are a Weixin user. You are a Weixin user if you either:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>register by linking a mobile number that uses international dialling code +86 (i.e., a “China Mainland mobile number”); or</strong></li><li><strong>have contracted with 深圳市腾讯计算机系统有限公司 (Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems Company Limited) for Weixin.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>If you are a Weixin user, you are subject to the Weixin</strong> <a href="https://weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?lang=en_US&amp;t=weixin_agreement&amp;s=default&amp;cc=CN"><strong>Agreement on Software License and Service of Tencent Weixin</strong></a> (the “<strong>Weixin Terms of Service</strong>”) <strong>and not to these Terms.</strong></p><p>You can also check whether you are a WeChat or Weixin user by clicking “Me” &gt; “Settings” &gt; “About” and then clicking the link to the “Terms of Service”. If you see the <em>WeChat – Terms of Service</em> then you are a WeChat user. If you see the <em>Agreement on Software License and Service of Tencent Weixin</em> then you are a Weixin user.</p><p>If there is a subsequent change in the international dialling code of the phone number linked to your WeChat or Weixin account (either from a China Mainland mobile number to a non-China Mainland mobile number, or vice versa), your account will be converted to either a WeChat or Weixin account (as the case may be), and you will be prompted to agree to the corresponding terms of service (either for WeChat or Weixin, as the case may be). You shall also be subject to, and shall abide by, any relevant laws and regulations that apply to the use of the new account (which may be different from those that applied prior to the conversion). If you convert your Weixin account to a WeChat account, these Terms apply to you from the date our system records such conversion. If you convert your WeChat account to a Weixin account, these Terms cease to apply to you from the date our system records such conversion. This function is intended to ensure we provide you with the features and services that are most relevant to your account. Any conversion shall also be in accordance with these Terms and any other applicable platform rules and regulations, and accounts which attempt to abuse this function (for example, by frequent switching) may have their access restricted in accordance with these Terms.</p><p><strong>INTEROPERABILITY WITH WEIXIN</strong></p><p>WeChat is interoperable with Weixin, such that you are able to communicate with Weixin users and view each other&#39;s Moments and Status in accordance with the applicable terms. You may also be able to use certain features operated by Weixin. Use of those features is subject to the relevant <a href="https://weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?lang=en_US&amp;t=weixin_agreement&amp;s=default&amp;cc=CN">Weixin Terms of Service</a> or service agreement applicable to such feature.

In such circumstances, “you” will include your Organisation.</p><p>We may translate these Terms into multiple languages. If there is any difference between the English version and any other language version of these Terms, the English version will apply (to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations).</p><h2 id="2-additional-terms-and-policies">2. <a id="additional_terms_and_policies"></a>ADDITIONAL TERMS AND POLICIES</h2><p>A diverse range of services and features are available within or via WeChat, and not all of these services and features are operated by us.

Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.</p><p><em>Mandatory Arbitration</em></p><p>Any dispute, controversy or claim (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) arising out of, relating to, or in connection with these Terms, including their existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach, or termination, will be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre under the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre in force when the Notice of Arbitration is submitted. The seat of the arbitration will be Singapore. There will be one arbitrator only. The arbitration proceedings will be conducted in English.</p><p><em>Mandatory Informal Resolution</em></p><p>You and we agree that, before either party initiates any legal proceedings, the parties will first attempt to informally resolve their dispute. You shall notify WeChat of your intent to initiate the informal dispute resolution process by emailing <a href="mailto:noticeofdispute@wechat.com">noticeofdispute@wechat.com</a>. The notice must contain the WeChat ID, name, telephone number, mailing address, and e-mail address of the initiating party, a factual description of the nature and basis of the dispute, the amount that the party is seeking for resolution of the dispute, and the personal signature of the party (a copy of which may be submitted via e-mail). An informal dispute resolution conference is to be held within sixty (60) days of such notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Any statute of limitations will be tolled while the parties try to resolve issues through this informal process. The informal dispute resolution conferences shall be individualized; multiple individuals initiating claims cannot participate in the same informal dispute resolution conference, unless mutually agreed to in writing by the parties. If a party is represented by counsel, the party’s counsel may participate in the conference, but both parties shall also fully participate in the conference. If the parties cannot resolve the issue within 60 days of the notice, either party can initiate the arbitration process. </p><p>Participating in this informal dispute resolution process is a requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration or any other legal proceeding. An arbitration or any other legal proceeding shall be dismissed if it was filed without fully and completely complying with these informal dispute resolution procedures.</p><p><em>Exceptions</em></p><p>Notwithstanding the above terms of this “Governing Law and Dispute Resolution” section:</p><ul><li>To the extent any applicable laws and regulations of your place of residence render the foregoing governing law and dispute resolution process unenforceable (for example, you may have statutory rights in your jurisdiction in relation to bringing or defending claims in a local court (including small claims court)), such laws and regulations will govern;</li><li>To the extent there is any inconsistency between any applicable Additional Terms and the terms in this section, the Additional Terms will prevail; and</li><li>To the extent any applicable Additional Terms expressly and entirely replace this section, those Additional Terms apply and supersede this section.</li></ul><h2 id="19-general">19. <a id="general"></a>GENERAL</h2><p><em>Entire Agreement</em></p><p>Subject to the applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction, these Terms (including the incorporated Additional Terms) set out the entire agreement between you and us in relation to WeChat – you agree that you will have no claim against us for any statement which is not explicitly set out in these Terms. The words &quot;include&quot; and &quot;including&quot; are to be construed without limitation. </p><p><em>Severability; Waiver</em></p><p>The invalidity of any provision of these Terms (or parts of any provision) will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision (or the remaining parts of that provision). If it is held that we cannot enforce any part of these Terms as drafted, we may replace those terms with similar terms to the extent enforceable under applicable laws and regulations, without changing the remaining terms of these Terms. No delay in enforcing any provision of these Terms will be construed to be a waiver of any rights under that provision. </p><p><em>Survival</em></p><p>Any rights and obligations under these Terms which by their nature should survive, including any obligations in relation to the liability of, or indemnities (if any) given by, the respective parties, and any dispute resolution clause, will remain in effect after termination or expiration of these Terms.</p><p><em>Transfer and Assignment</em></p><p>No person other than you and us will have any right to enforce these Terms, whether pursuant to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 2001 (Chapter 53B) of Singapore or otherwise, and you may not delegate, assign or transfer these Terms or any rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior consent.

You and we agree that the activities in these Terms relate to foreign and interstate commerce.</p><p><em>Mandatory Informal Resolution</em></p><p>You and we agree that, before either party initiates a legal proceeding, the parties will first attempt to informally resolve their Dispute. Either party shall notify the other party of its intent to initiate the informal resolution process for a Dispute by sending a written notice of the Dispute (“<strong>Notice of Dispute</strong>”). You shall send your Notice of Dispute to <a href="mailto:noticeofdispute@wechat.com">noticeofdispute@wechat.com</a>. If we have a Dispute with you, we will send a Notice of Dispute to the contact information we have in our files for you. The Notice of Dispute must contain the name, telephone number, mailing address, and e-mail address of the initiating party, the WeChat ID at issue, a factual description of the nature and basis of the Dispute, the amount and any other remedy that the party is seeking for resolution of the Dispute, and the personal signature of the party. The parties will negotiate in good faith for sixty (60) days after either you or we receive a Notice of Dispute that complies with all of these requirements. A non-compliant Notice of Dispute does not start the 60-day informal resolution period. The parties shall hold an informal dispute resolution conference (telephonic or video) within the 60-day informal resolution period, if either party requests one. Any statute of limitations will be tolled while the parties try to resolve issues through this informal process. The informal dispute resolution conferences shall be individualized; multiple individuals initiating claims cannot participate in the same informal dispute resolution conference, unless mutually agreed to in writing by the parties. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference. If you choose to have your counsel attend the conference, our counsel may attend the conference, but we will also have a company representative fully participate in the conference.</p><p>Participating in this informal dispute resolution process is a requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing any legal proceeding. A legal proceeding shall be dismissed if it was filed without fully and completely complying with these informal dispute resolution procedures. In particular, if either of us commence an arbitration without first having sent a compliant Notice of Dispute and complying with other informal dispute resolution procedures described above (including participating in an informal dispute resolution conference if either party requests one), the arbitration provider has no jurisdiction over the Dispute and shall administratively close the Dispute. If the arbitration provider fails to close such Dispute, a court may enter injunctive relief to enforce the informal dispute resolution requirements, including an injunction to stay any arbitration that has been commenced in violation of these requirements.</p><p><em>Arbitration Forum and Rules</em></p><p>If you and we are unable to come to informal resolution, you and we agree to binding individual arbitration before Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“<strong>JAMS</strong>”) under its Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures, available at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/">https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/</a>, or, if applicable, its Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines, available at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/mass-arbitration-procedures">https://www.jamsadr.com/mass-arbitration-procedures</a>, and pursuant to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. The fees and costs of the arbitration will be borne by the parties according to the then-applicable JAMS Schedule of Fees and Costs. JAMS may also be reached at 800.352.5267 for further information. The terms in this Arbitration Agreement govern to the extent they conflict with JAMS rules.</p><p>Any arbitration hearing will take place virtually or in the county where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The arbitrator shall be a retired federal judge. The arbitrator shall have the authority to consider and grant dispositive motions and will apply the standards of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing such motions. Except as expressly provided in the paragraphs entitled “Mandatory Informal Resolution” and the paragraph entitled “Opt-Out of Modifications,” the arbitrator, and not any federal or state court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the validity, interpretation, applicability, scope, or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate, including, but not limited to, the arbitrability of any Dispute and any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable, to the extent permitted by applicable law. The arbitrator shall make a decision in writing, which will include the findings and conclusions on which the decision is based. The arbitrator has the authority to issue any relief allowed by applicable law, but the arbitrator shall have no authority to issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.</p><p><em>Demand for Arbitration</em></p><p>A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written demand for arbitration to JAMS and give notice to the other party as specified in JAMS rules. The demand for arbitration submitted by either you or us must identify the WeChat ID at issue, the claim(s) asserted, factual basis for the claim(s), and relief and/or remedy sought. The demand for arbitration must be personally signed by the party seeking arbitration. A failure to follow these filing requirements shall be a basis for dismissal of the demand for arbitration, including by a Process Administrator, as defined in JAMS Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines. By signing any demand for arbitration, the signing party certifies to the best of its knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that (i) the demand for arbitration is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (ii) the claims and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (iii) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery. The arbitrator shall be authorized to afford any relief or impose any sanctions available under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 or any analogous state law for either party’s violation of this requirement.</p><p><em>Offer of Judgment</em></p><p>In the arbitration proceedings, a party may serve a written offer of judgment on the other party to allow judgment on specific terms at least ten (10) days before the date set for the arbitration hearing. If the offer is accepted, the offer with proof of acceptance shall be submitted to JAMS, which shall issue an award accordingly. If the offer is not accepted prior to the arbitration hearing or within thirty (30) days after it is made, whichever occurs first, it shall be deemed withdrawn and cannot be given as evidence in the arbitration, other than with respect to costs. If the judgment that the other party finally obtains is not more favorable than the unaccepted offer, then the other party shall pay the costs incurred after the offer was made, to the extent such cost-shifting is not prohibited by applicable law or JAMS rules, provided that the arbitrator shall have discretion to release you from the obligation to cover our costs in circumstances of financial hardship.</p><p><em>Grouped Arbitrations</em></p><p>To the extent permitted by applicable law and notwithstanding any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement, if fifty (50) or more claimants represented by the same or coordinated counsel file demands for arbitration raising substantially similar Disputes, those coordinated filings are considered “Mass Arbitrations” under JAMS Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines, and you and we agree that the following additional procedures shall apply: (1) once counsel representing you in the Mass Arbitrations has submitted at least 50 compliant demands for arbitration to JAMS and the Process Administrator has heard and determined preliminary and administrative matters in accordance with JAMS Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines and this Arbitration Agreement, the parties shall cooperate to organize the demands for arbitration into randomized groups of 50 claimants each (plus, to the extent there are fewer than 50 claimants remaining, a final group consisting of the remaining claimants), with each group proceeding as a single consolidated arbitration (a “<strong>Grouped Arbitration</strong>”) and with a single arbitrator presiding over each group; (2) for each Grouped Arbitration, the arbitrator presiding over that group shall decide all common issues of fact and law first—including considering and granting dispositive motions under the standards of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing such motions—before proceeding to deciding individual factual and legal issues and issuing individualized final awards; (3) within each Grouped Arbitration, discovery shall be consolidated and coordinated; and (4) no final award from an arbitrator shall have preclusive effect in another arbitration; an order in a Grouped Arbitration, however, may be shared for its persuasive value in related Grouped Arbitration proceedings.</p><p><em>Appeals</em></p><p>If the arbitration involves a request for an injunction or monetary relief that exceeds one million U.S. dollars (USD 1,000,000)—or in the case of a Grouped Arbitration, individual monetary relief that exceeds thirty thousand U.S. dollars (USD 30,000)—then either party shall have the right to appeal any award on such request for relief to an arbitration appellate panel. Appeals of individual awards within a Grouped Arbitration shall proceed as a single consolidated appeal before one arbitration appellate panel. The notice of appeal must be served, in writing, on the opposing party within fourteen (14) days after the award has become final. Notice of appeal in a Grouped Arbitration may be served on the parties’ respective arbitration counsel. JAMS shall administer the appeal consistent with JAMS Optional Appeal Procedures, available at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/appeal/">https://www.jamsadr.com/appeal/</a>.  </p><p><em>Waiver of Class, Consolidated, and Representative Actions; Severance of Public Injunctive Relief</em></p><p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED ABOVE IN THE PARAGRAPH ENTITLED “GROUPED ARBITRATIONS,” CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS, CLASS ARBITRATIONS, COLLECTIVE ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL ACTIONS, AND ANY OTHER PROCEEDING WHERE SOMEONE ACTS IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ARE NOT ALLOWED, NOR IS COMBINING INDIVIDUAL PROCEEDINGS WITHOUT THE WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES. YOU AND WE AGREE NOT TO ACT IN THE CAPACITY OF A NAMED PLAINTIFF, CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, OPT-IN PLAINTIFF, CLASS MEMBER, OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY CAPACITY IN A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY. THIS PROVISION DOES NOT PREVENT YOU OR US FROM SETTLING CLAIMS ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. AS STATED IN THE PARAGRAPH ENTITLED “SCOPE OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT” ABOVE, YOU AND WE BOTH AGREE TO SEVER ANY REQUEST FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND LITIGATE THAT ISSUE IN COURT AFTER FINISHING ARBITRATION FOR THE REMAINING CLAIMS (INCLUDING ALL ISSUES OF LIABILITY).  </p><p><em>Waiver of Jury Trial</em></p><p>EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF WECHAT.</p><p><em>Venue</em></p><p>For Disputes that are not subject to arbitration as expressly set forth in this Arbitration Agreement or as required by applicable law (other than small claims actions), the exclusive venue shall be the federal courts located in the State of California. If those courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction, then the exclusive venue shall be the state courts in the State of California. You and we consent to the jurisdiction of such California courts for purposes of such proceedings.</p><p><em>Opt-Out of Modifications</em></p><p>If you have previously agreed to arbitrate with us, you may opt out of the modifications to your prior arbitration agreement made by this Arbitration Agreement by sending us written notice no later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of this Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us, and all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply to you. To be effective, your written notice must be sent to <a href="mailto:noticeofdispute@wechat.com">noticeofdispute@wechat.com</a> and must include your name, mailing address, WeChat ID, the phone number used to set up your account, and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. This written notice must be dated and personally signed by you, and not any attorney, agent, or other representative of yours. Should you not opt out within the 30-day period in accordance with this procedure, you and we shall be bound by the terms of this Arbitration Agreement in full. You and we agree that if you do not opt out in accordance with this procedure but either you or we commence an arbitration and seek to apply an arbitration agreement between you and us that predates this Arbitration Agreement, either you or we may seek injunctive relief in court, and a court may enter injunctive relief enjoining the filing of arbitration under the prior agreement.</p><p><em>Severability</em></p><p>If the class action waiver in the paragraph entitled “Waiver of Class, Consolidated, and Representative Actions; Severance of Public Injunctive Relief” is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, then those parts will not be arbitrated but will proceed in court, with the rest proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed, but the rest of these provisions regarding arbitration still apply.</p></blockquote><h2 id="schedule-2-australia-specific-terms"><a id="schedule_2_australia_specific_terms"></a>SCHEDULE 2: AUSTRALIA-SPECIFIC TERMS</h2><p><em>If you are a user of WeChat in Australia, the below Additional Terms: (a) are incorporated into these Terms; (b) apply to your use of WeChat; and (c) override the head terms of these Terms to the extent of any inconsistency.</em></p><p>All express or implied guarantees, warranties, representations, or other terms and conditions relating to these Terms or their subject matter, not contained in these Terms, are excluded from these Terms to the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations.</p><p>Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts or modifies any guarantee, warranty, term or condition, right or remedy implied or imposed by any applicable laws and regulations which cannot lawfully be excluded, restricted or modified.</p><p>If any guarantee, condition, warranty or term is implied or imposed by any applicable laws and regulations and cannot be excluded (a “<strong>Non-Excludable Provision</strong>”), and we are able to limit your remedy for a breach of the Non-Excludable Provision, then our liability for breach of the Non-Excludable Provision is limited to one or more of the following at our option:</p><ul><li>in the case of goods, the replacement of the goods or the supply of equivalent goods, the repair of the goods, the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of acquiring equivalent goods, or the payment of the cost of having the goods repaired; or</li><li>in the case of services, the supplying of the services again, or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.</li></ul><h2 id="schedule-3-european-union-and-united-kingdom-specific-terms"><a id="schedule_3_european_union_and_united_kingdom_specific_terms"></a>SCHEDULE 3: EUROPEAN UNION AND UNITED KINGDOM-SPECIFIC TERMS</h2><p><em>If you are a user of WeChat and located in the United Kingdom or European Union, the below Additional Terms: (a) are incorporated into these Terms; (b) apply to your use of WeChat; and (c) override the head terms of these Terms to the extent of any inconsistency.</em></p><p><em>Refund of your purchases</em></p><p>If you have purchased and paid for a WeChat product or service provided by us (and not by any third parties), you may receive a refund for such purchase if we receive a refund request from you within 14 days from the date you completed the relevant purchase.

Where this is the case, the relevant contracting entity will be identified in the relevant WeChat service-specific terms. These Terms (including those relevant service-specific terms) will apply between you and that identified contracting entity in relation to your use of the relevant WeChat service or feature. Please review these Terms and our policies and instructions to understand how you can and cannot use WeChat. You must comply with these Terms in your use of WeChat and only use WeChat as permitted by applicable laws and regulations, wherever you may be when you use them. In some countries, there are restrictions on your use of WeChat – it is your responsibility to ensure that you are legally allowed to use WeChat where you are located, and certain WeChat functionalities may not be available in some countries.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;By using WeChat, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use WeChat.&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;These Terms contain provisions governing how claims can be brought between you and us (see Section 18 and Schedules 1 and 3 of the Addendum below). If you are a WeChat user residing in the United States, Schedule 1 of the Addendum below, entitled “United States-Specific Terms,” requires you to resolve all disputes with us on an individual basis and, with limited exceptions, through final and binding arbitration, &#60;em&#62;rather than in court. Schedule 1 of the Addendum also explains how you can opt out of this arbitration agreement in some circumstances.&#60;/em&#62; Please read these provisions carefully.&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Other Users&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;These Terms only apply to you if you are a WeChat user, meaning that you have registered by linking a mobile number that uses international dialling codes other than +86 (a “non-China Mainland mobile number”).&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;These Terms do not apply to you if you are a Weixin user.

If you see the &#60;em&#62;WeChat – Terms of Service&#60;/em&#62; then you are a WeChat user. If you see the &#60;em&#62;Agreement on Software License and Service of Tencent Weixin&#60;/em&#62; then you are a Weixin user.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If there is a subsequent change in the international dialling code of the phone number linked to your WeChat or Weixin account (either from a China Mainland mobile number to a non-China Mainland mobile number, or vice versa), your account will be converted to either a WeChat or Weixin account (as the case may be), and you will be prompted to agree to the corresponding terms of service (either for WeChat or Weixin, as the case may be). You shall also be subject to, and shall abide by, any relevant laws and regulations that apply to the use of the new account (which may be different from those that applied prior to the conversion). If you convert your Weixin account to a WeChat account, these Terms apply to you from the date our system records such conversion. If you convert your WeChat account to a Weixin account, these Terms cease to apply to you from the date our system records such conversion. This function is intended to ensure we provide you with the features and services that are most relevant to your account. Any conversion shall also be in accordance with these Terms and any other applicable platform rules and regulations, and accounts which attempt to abuse this function (for example, by frequent switching) may have their access restricted in accordance with these Terms.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;INTEROPERABILITY WITH WEIXIN&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;WeChat is interoperable with Weixin, such that you are able to communicate with Weixin users and view each other&#38;#39;s Moments and Status in accordance with the applicable terms. You may also be able to use certain features operated by Weixin. Use of those features is subject to the relevant &#60;a href=&#34;https://weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?lang=en_US&#38;amp;t=weixin_agreement&#38;amp;s=default&#38;amp;cc=CN&#34;&#62;Weixin Terms of Service&#60;/a&#62; or service agreement applicable to such feature.

Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Mandatory Arbitration&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Any dispute, controversy or claim (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) arising out of, relating to, or in connection with these Terms, including their existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach, or termination, will be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre under the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre in force when the Notice of Arbitration is submitted. The seat of the arbitration will be Singapore. There will be one arbitrator only. The arbitration proceedings will be conducted in English.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Mandatory Informal Resolution&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;You and we agree that, before either party initiates any legal proceedings, the parties will first attempt to informally resolve their dispute. You shall notify WeChat of your intent to initiate the informal dispute resolution process by emailing &#60;a href=&#34;mailto:noticeofdispute@wechat.com&#34;&#62;noticeofdispute@wechat.com&#60;/a&#62;. The notice must contain the WeChat ID, name, telephone number, mailing address, and e-mail address of the initiating party, a factual description of the nature and basis of the dispute, the amount that the party is seeking for resolution of the dispute, and the personal signature of the party (a copy of which may be submitted via e-mail). An informal dispute resolution conference is to be held within sixty (60) days of such notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Any statute of limitations will be tolled while the parties try to resolve issues through this informal process. The informal dispute resolution conferences shall be individualized; multiple individuals initiating claims cannot participate in the same informal dispute resolution conference, unless mutually agreed to in writing by the parties. If a party is represented by counsel, the party’s counsel may participate in the conference, but both parties shall also fully participate in the conference. If the parties cannot resolve the issue within 60 days of the notice, either party can initiate the arbitration process. &#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Participating in this informal dispute resolution process is a requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration or any other legal proceeding. An arbitration or any other legal proceeding shall be dismissed if it was filed without fully and completely complying with these informal dispute resolution procedures.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Exceptions&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Notwithstanding the above terms of this “Governing Law and Dispute Resolution” section:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;ul&#62;&#60;li&#62;To the extent any applicable laws and regulations of your place of residence render the foregoing governing law and dispute resolution process unenforceable (for example, you may have statutory rights in your jurisdiction in relation to bringing or defending claims in a local court (including small claims court)), such laws and regulations will govern;&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;To the extent there is any inconsistency between any applicable Additional Terms and the terms in this section, the Additional Terms will prevail; and&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;To the extent any applicable Additional Terms expressly and entirely replace this section, those Additional Terms apply and supersede this section.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ul&#62;&#60;h2 id=&#34;19-general&#34;&#62;19. &#60;a id=&#34;general&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62;GENERAL&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Entire Agreement&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Subject to the applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction, these Terms (including the incorporated Additional Terms) set out the entire agreement between you and us in relation to WeChat – you agree that you will have no claim against us for any statement which is not explicitly set out in these Terms. The words &#38;quot;include&#38;quot; and &#38;quot;including&#38;quot; are to be construed without limitation. &#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Severability; Waiver&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The invalidity of any provision of these Terms (or parts of any provision) will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision (or the remaining parts of that provision). If it is held that we cannot enforce any part of these Terms as drafted, we may replace those terms with similar terms to the extent enforceable under applicable laws and regulations, without changing the remaining terms of these Terms. No delay in enforcing any provision of these Terms will be construed to be a waiver of any rights under that provision. &#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Survival&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Any rights and obligations under these Terms which by their nature should survive, including any obligations in relation to the liability of, or indemnities (if any) given by, the respective parties, and any dispute resolution clause, will remain in effect after termination or expiration of these Terms.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Transfer and Assignment&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;No person other than you and us will have any right to enforce these Terms, whether pursuant to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 2001 (Chapter 53B) of Singapore or otherwise, and you may not delegate, assign or transfer these Terms or any rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior consent. We may freely assign or transfer these Terms or our rights and obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, without your prior consent or prior notice to you. &#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Sub-contracting&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We may freely sub-contract any part of our performance of these Terms at any time, without your prior consent or prior notice to you.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;br/&#62;&#60;h1 id=&#34;addendum-additional-country-specific-terms&#34;&#62;&#60;a id=&#34;addendum_additional_country_specific_terms&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62;ADDENDUM: ADDITIONAL COUNTRY-SPECIFIC TERMS&#60;/h1&#62;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#60;h2 id=&#34;schedule-1-united-states-specific-terms&#34;&#62;&#60;a id=&#34;schedule_1_united_states_specific_terms&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62;SCHEDULE 1: UNITED STATES-SPECIFIC TERMS&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you are a user of WeChat residing in the United States, the terms contained in this Schedule 1 (this “&#60;strong&#62;Arbitration Agreement&#60;/strong&#62;”) are incorporated into these Terms and expressly and entirely replace the above “Governing Law and Dispute Resolution” section of these Terms.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Scope of Arbitration Agreement&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;You and we agree that all disputes, controversies, or claims (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) arising out of, relating to, or in connection with these Terms or your use of WeChat, or any aspect of your relationship with us (“&#60;strong&#62;Disputes&#60;/strong&#62;”), shall be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement, except (1) you may assert individual claims in small claims court in the county in which you reside if the small claims court has jurisdiction (which issue should be decided by that court); (2) any request for public injunctive relief will be litigated in court after finishing arbitration of the remaining claims, as discussed below in the paragraph entitled “Waiver of Class, Consolidated, and Representative Actions; Severance of Public Injunctive Relief”; (3) a court may enter injunctive relief to enforce the pre-filing mandatory informal resolution requirements as provided below in the paragraphs entitled “Mandatory Informal Resolution”; and (4) a court may enjoin the filing of an arbitration seeking to apply a prior arbitration agreement as provided below in the paragraph entitled “Opt-Out of Modifications.” This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all Disputes that arose, accrued, or were asserted before, on, or after the effective date of these Terms or this Arbitration Agreement, whether based on past, present, or future events.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Governing Law&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;These Terms and any Dispute will be governed by Delaware law, without regard to conflict of law principles, except the Federal Arbitration Act (“&#60;strong&#62;FAA&#60;/strong&#62;”) governs all issues related to arbitration, including the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. You and we agree that the activities in these Terms relate to foreign and interstate commerce.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Mandatory Informal Resolution&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;You and we agree that, before either party initiates a legal proceeding, the parties will first attempt to informally resolve their Dispute. Either party shall notify the other party of its intent to initiate the informal resolution process for a Dispute by sending a written notice of the Dispute (“&#60;strong&#62;Notice of Dispute&#60;/strong&#62;”). You shall send your Notice of Dispute to &#60;a href=&#34;mailto:noticeofdispute@wechat.com&#34;&#62;noticeofdispute@wechat.com&#60;/a&#62;. If we have a Dispute with you, we will send a Notice of Dispute to the contact information we have in our files for you. The Notice of Dispute must contain the name, telephone number, mailing address, and e-mail address of the initiating party, the WeChat ID at issue, a factual description of the nature and basis of the Dispute, the amount and any other remedy that the party is seeking for resolution of the Dispute, and the personal signature of the party. The parties will negotiate in good faith for sixty (60) days after either you or we receive a Notice of Dispute that complies with all of these requirements. A non-compliant Notice of Dispute does not start the 60-day informal resolution period. The parties shall hold an informal dispute resolution conference (telephonic or video) within the 60-day informal resolution period, if either party requests one. Any statute of limitations will be tolled while the parties try to resolve issues through this informal process. The informal dispute resolution conferences shall be individualized; multiple individuals initiating claims cannot participate in the same informal dispute resolution conference, unless mutually agreed to in writing by the parties. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference. If you choose to have your counsel attend the conference, our counsel may attend the conference, but we will also have a company representative fully participate in the conference.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Participating in this informal dispute resolution process is a requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing any legal proceeding. A legal proceeding shall be dismissed if it was filed without fully and completely complying with these informal dispute resolution procedures. In particular, if either of us commence an arbitration without first having sent a compliant Notice of Dispute and complying with other informal dispute resolution procedures described above (including participating in an informal dispute resolution conference if either party requests one), the arbitration provider has no jurisdiction over the Dispute and shall administratively close the Dispute. If the arbitration provider fails to close such Dispute, a court may enter injunctive relief to enforce the informal dispute resolution requirements, including an injunction to stay any arbitration that has been commenced in violation of these requirements.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Arbitration Forum and Rules&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you and we are unable to come to informal resolution, you and we agree to binding individual arbitration before Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“&#60;strong&#62;JAMS&#60;/strong&#62;”) under its Streamlined Arbitration Rules &#38;amp; Procedures, available at &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/&#34;&#62;https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/&#60;/a&#62;, or, if applicable, its Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines, available at &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.jamsadr.com/mass-arbitration-procedures&#34;&#62;https://www.jamsadr.com/mass-arbitration-procedures&#60;/a&#62;, and pursuant to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. The fees and costs of the arbitration will be borne by the parties according to the then-applicable JAMS Schedule of Fees and Costs. JAMS may also be reached at 800.352.5267 for further information. The terms in this Arbitration Agreement govern to the extent they conflict with JAMS rules.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Any arbitration hearing will take place virtually or in the county where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The arbitrator shall be a retired federal judge. The arbitrator shall have the authority to consider and grant dispositive motions and will apply the standards of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing such motions. Except as expressly provided in the paragraphs entitled “Mandatory Informal Resolution” and the paragraph entitled “Opt-Out of Modifications,” the arbitrator, and not any federal or state court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the validity, interpretation, applicability, scope, or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate, including, but not limited to, the arbitrability of any Dispute and any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable, to the extent permitted by applicable law. The arbitrator shall make a decision in writing, which will include the findings and conclusions on which the decision is based. The arbitrator has the authority to issue any relief allowed by applicable law, but the arbitrator shall have no authority to issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Demand for Arbitration&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written demand for arbitration to JAMS and give notice to the other party as specified in JAMS rules. The demand for arbitration submitted by either you or us must identify the WeChat ID at issue, the claim(s) asserted, factual basis for the claim(s), and relief and/or remedy sought. The demand for arbitration must be personally signed by the party seeking arbitration. A failure to follow these filing requirements shall be a basis for dismissal of the demand for arbitration, including by a Process Administrator, as defined in JAMS Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines. By signing any demand for arbitration, the signing party certifies to the best of its knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that (i) the demand for arbitration is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (ii) the claims and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (iii) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery. The arbitrator shall be authorized to afford any relief or impose any sanctions available under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 or any analogous state law for either party’s violation of this requirement.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Offer of Judgment&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In the arbitration proceedings, a party may serve a written offer of judgment on the other party to allow judgment on specific terms at least ten (10) days before the date set for the arbitration hearing. If the offer is accepted, the offer with proof of acceptance shall be submitted to JAMS, which shall issue an award accordingly. If the offer is not accepted prior to the arbitration hearing or within thirty (30) days after it is made, whichever occurs first, it shall be deemed withdrawn and cannot be given as evidence in the arbitration, other than with respect to costs. If the judgment that the other party finally obtains is not more favorable than the unaccepted offer, then the other party shall pay the costs incurred after the offer was made, to the extent such cost-shifting is not prohibited by applicable law or JAMS rules, provided that the arbitrator shall have discretion to release you from the obligation to cover our costs in circumstances of financial hardship.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Grouped Arbitrations&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;To the extent permitted by applicable law and notwithstanding any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement, if fifty (50) or more claimants represented by the same or coordinated counsel file demands for arbitration raising substantially similar Disputes, those coordinated filings are considered “Mass Arbitrations” under JAMS Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines, and you and we agree that the following additional procedures shall apply: (1) once counsel representing you in the Mass Arbitrations has submitted at least 50 compliant demands for arbitration to JAMS and the Process Administrator has heard and determined preliminary and administrative matters in accordance with JAMS Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines and this Arbitration Agreement, the parties shall cooperate to organize the demands for arbitration into randomized groups of 50 claimants each (plus, to the extent there are fewer than 50 claimants remaining, a final group consisting of the remaining claimants), with each group proceeding as a single consolidated arbitration (a “&#60;strong&#62;Grouped Arbitration&#60;/strong&#62;”) and with a single arbitrator presiding over each group; (2) for each Grouped Arbitration, the arbitrator presiding over that group shall decide all common issues of fact and law first—including considering and granting dispositive motions under the standards of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing such motions—before proceeding to deciding individual factual and legal issues and issuing individualized final awards; (3) within each Grouped Arbitration, discovery shall be consolidated and coordinated; and (4) no final award from an arbitrator shall have preclusive effect in another arbitration; an order in a Grouped Arbitration, however, may be shared for its persuasive value in related Grouped Arbitration proceedings.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Appeals&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If the arbitration involves a request for an injunction or monetary relief that exceeds one million U.S. dollars (USD 1,000,000)—or in the case of a Grouped Arbitration, individual monetary relief that exceeds thirty thousand U.S. dollars (USD 30,000)—then either party shall have the right to appeal any award on such request for relief to an arbitration appellate panel. Appeals of individual awards within a Grouped Arbitration shall proceed as a single consolidated appeal before one arbitration appellate panel. The notice of appeal must be served, in writing, on the opposing party within fourteen (14) days after the award has become final. Notice of appeal in a Grouped Arbitration may be served on the parties’ respective arbitration counsel. JAMS shall administer the appeal consistent with JAMS Optional Appeal Procedures, available at &#60;a href=&#34;https://www.jamsadr.com/appeal/&#34;&#62;https://www.jamsadr.com/appeal/&#60;/a&#62;.  &#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Waiver of Class, Consolidated, and Representative Actions; Severance of Public Injunctive Relief&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED ABOVE IN THE PARAGRAPH ENTITLED “GROUPED ARBITRATIONS,” CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS, CLASS ARBITRATIONS, COLLECTIVE ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL ACTIONS, AND ANY OTHER PROCEEDING WHERE SOMEONE ACTS IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ARE NOT ALLOWED, NOR IS COMBINING INDIVIDUAL PROCEEDINGS WITHOUT THE WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES. YOU AND WE AGREE NOT TO ACT IN THE CAPACITY OF A NAMED PLAINTIFF, CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, OPT-IN PLAINTIFF, CLASS MEMBER, OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY CAPACITY IN A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY. THIS PROVISION DOES NOT PREVENT YOU OR US FROM SETTLING CLAIMS ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. AS STATED IN THE PARAGRAPH ENTITLED “SCOPE OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT” ABOVE, YOU AND WE BOTH AGREE TO SEVER ANY REQUEST FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND LITIGATE THAT ISSUE IN COURT AFTER FINISHING ARBITRATION FOR THE REMAINING CLAIMS (INCLUDING ALL ISSUES OF LIABILITY).  &#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Waiver of Jury Trial&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF WECHAT.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Venue&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;For Disputes that are not subject to arbitration as expressly set forth in this Arbitration Agreement or as required by applicable law (other than small claims actions), the exclusive venue shall be the federal courts located in the State of California. If those courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction, then the exclusive venue shall be the state courts in the State of California. You and we consent to the jurisdiction of such California courts for purposes of such proceedings.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Opt-Out of Modifications&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you have previously agreed to arbitrate with us, you may opt out of the modifications to your prior arbitration agreement made by this Arbitration Agreement by sending us written notice no later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of this Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us, and all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply to you. To be effective, your written notice must be sent to &#60;a href=&#34;mailto:noticeofdispute@wechat.com&#34;&#62;noticeofdispute@wechat.com&#60;/a&#62; and must include your name, mailing address, WeChat ID, the phone number used to set up your account, and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. This written notice must be dated and personally signed by you, and not any attorney, agent, or other representative of yours. Should you not opt out within the 30-day period in accordance with this procedure, you and we shall be bound by the terms of this Arbitration Agreement in full. You and we agree that if you do not opt out in accordance with this procedure but either you or we commence an arbitration and seek to apply an arbitration agreement between you and us that predates this Arbitration Agreement, either you or we may seek injunctive relief in court, and a court may enter injunctive relief enjoining the filing of arbitration under the prior agreement.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;Severability&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If the class action waiver in the paragraph entitled “Waiver of Class, Consolidated, and Representative Actions; Severance of Public Injunctive Relief” is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, then those parts will not be arbitrated but will proceed in court, with the rest proceeding in arbitration.
