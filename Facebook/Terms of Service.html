For example, we use information about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products to personalize your experience.</p><p class="w">For more information about how we use information to provide you with a personalised experience, please review our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p><p class="w">We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organizations and others that matter to you across the Meta Products you use, and (if you choose to engage with people on a third party’s products) third party products. We use the information we have to make suggestions for you – for example, groups to join, events to attend, Facebook Pages to follow or send a message to, shows to watch and people you may want to become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we believe that our Products are most useful when people are connected to people, groups and organizations that they care about. We want the content and suggestions that you see on Facebook to be as interesting and valuable to you as possible. Please see our <a href="https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Ffeatures%2Fexplaining-ranking%2F&amp;h=AT0nG9ikhVQKs8UwxVZtIIyk-6PdM-Ai-CDtTsqGVeWSDrTyyUn4fS91aDrWhWKsi0qLPUXRdb5xNIKhJS1lYI8-iCyqQ6YHjvYYFsU8myN5VqJZEDBqQY8uB3iconCfVaqgFZdj18JEI3Pdn3CI0Q" target="_blank">Recommender Systems’ System Cards</a> for information on how our various recommender systems prioritize signals to determine which content and suggestions to show you, as well as options for customizing your experience.</p><p class="w">To help you discover content, products and services that may interest you, we show you offers and other sponsored or commercial content to help you discover content, products and services that are offered by the many businesses and organizations that use Facebook and other Meta Products.</p><p class="w">Section 2 below explains this in more detail.</p><p class="w">Our Products provide many ways to express yourself or communicate with friends, family, and others about what matters to you - for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos, and stories across the Meta Products (consistent with your settings), sending messages or making voice or video calls to a friend or several people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile as well as showing you insights on how others engage with your content. We have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging content on Meta Products.</p><p class="w">We engage in research to develop, test and improve our Products. This includes analyzing information that we have about our users, and understanding how people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features. We use and develop advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning systems and augmented reality so that people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or geographic location. For example, technology such as this helps people who have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos shared on Facebook. We also build sophisticated network and communication technology to help more people connect to the Internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to improve our ability to protect our community and our Products.</p><p class="w">For more information about how we use your information to provide, develop and improve Meta Products, please review our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p></div><div><h2 class="bi n">1.2 Promote the safety, security, and integrity of our Products, combat harmful conduct and keep our community of users safe:</h2><p class="w">People will only build community on Meta Products if they feel safe and secure. We work hard to maintain the security (including the availability, authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality) of our Products and services. We employ dedicated teams around the world, work with external service providers, partners and other relevant entities, and develop advanced technical systems to detect potential misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others, and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our community, including to respond to user reports of potentially violating content. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we will take appropriate action that may include notifying you, offering help, removing or restricting content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling an account, or contacting law enforcement.

We share information data with other <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678?ref=tos" target="_blank">Meta Companies</a> when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products or to help keep Meta Products, users and the community safe. For example, we share information with Meta Companies that provide financial products and services to help them promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable law. Meta may access, preserve, use and share any information it collects about you where it has a good faith belief it is required or permitted by law to do so.

For example, we use information about the people you engage with on Facebook to make it easier for you to connect with them on Messenger, and we enable you to communicate with a business you follow on Facebook through Messenger.</p></div><div><h2 class="bi n">1.4 Communicating with you:</h2><p class="w">We may need to send you communications, like emails or in-product notices, to respond to you or inform you about any product-related issues, research, or our terms and policies.

The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Products. This infrastructure may be owned, operated, or controlled by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, or its affiliates.

How our services are funded</h1><p class="w">You can choose to use our Products for free with ads or to subscribe to use without ads:</p><ul class="be"><li class="bf">If you choose to use our Products for free with ads, you allow us to show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Products.</li><li class="bf">If you choose to subscribe to use our Products without ads, you won’t see ads from us and we do not use your data for ads. The details of price, currency and payment period for the subscription for no ads will be provided to you before you complete your purchase.</li></ul><p class="w">Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our ads system. If we show you ads on Meta Products, we show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal information and we don't share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission. Instead, we allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal, and the kind of audience they want to see their ads (for example, people between the age of 18-35 who live close to the advertiser’s store in Portugal). We then show their ad to people who we think might find it relevant.</p><p class="w">We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Meta Products. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We don’t share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Meta ads work <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/ads" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p class="w">You can learn about how we collect and use your information in our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>, including more detail on the different types of information we use to show you ads (if we show you ads on Meta Products). You have controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the types of information we use to determine which ads we show you. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/ads" target="_blank">Learn more</a>.</p><div></div><a class="bc" href="#"><span class="bd n">Return to top</span><img src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v4/yu/r/LXW6SLg3Dw0.png" width="16" height="16" class="r l"></a></div><div class="s" id="section_3"><a id="5"></a><h1 class="t n">3.

Permission to use content you create and share: </b> Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/325807937506242?ref=tos" target="_blank">privacy</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1727608884153160?ref=tos" target="_blank">application</a> settings).

A termination for good cause is possible only within a reasonable time frame after becoming aware of the violation.</p><p class="w">If the good cause is a breach of an obligation of these Terms, termination is permitted only after an unsuccessful granted cure duty has expired, or after an unsuccessful warning. However, a time limit for remedy and a warning are not necessary if the other side refuses to fulfill their obligations seriously and with finality or if special circumstances justify an immediate termination, having weighed the interests of both parties.</p><p class="w">You can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/103873106370583?ref=tos" target="_blank">learn more</a> about what you can do if your account has been disabled and how to contact us if you think we have disabled your account by mistake.</p><p class="w">If you delete or we disable or delete your account, and you stop accessing, or using Facebook and the other Meta Products, or if this contract is otherwise terminated, then these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, except for the following provisions, which will remain in place: (3, 4.2-4.5).</p><h2 class="bi n">4.3 Limits on liability</h2><p class="w">We are liable only as follows: We have unlimited liability in accordance with statutory provisions: arising out of injury damaging to life, limb or health; in case of intent; of gross negligence; and in accordance with the Product Liability Act.</p><p class="w">Without limiting any of the above, we shall be liable for slight negligence only in the case of violation of an "essential" obligation under this agreement. "Essential" obligations in this sense are obligations necessary for the fulfillment of the agreement, the breach of which would jeopardize the purpose of the agreement in question, and which you can trust to be complied with. In these cases, liability is limited to typical and foreseeable damages; in other cases, there is no liability for slight negligence.</p><h2 class="bi n">4.4 Disputes</h2><p class="w">If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Meta Products as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p><p class="w">If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Meta Products in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Meta Products for a business or commercial purpose, or that an entity brings on your behalf, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and Irish law will apply to such claim or dispute without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p><h2 class="bi n">4.5 Miscellaneous</h2><ol class="bk"><li class="bf"><b>Supplemental Terms:</b> Some of the Products we offer are also governed by supplemental terms.
