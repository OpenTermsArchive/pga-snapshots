We can remove content that violates our terms and policies, or share information with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of death or imminent bodily harm.</p><h3 class="bu n">Performance</h3><p class="v">For example, we collect information when people use our Products, even if they don’t have an account, to measure how fast our pages load in different countries and whether they're working properly.

So if your friend Ahmad comments on a post about national parks, we can suggest the national parks post to you.</li><li class="x">If you and others interact with the same group, Facebook Page or post, we can suggest another group, Page or post that they interact with for you. So if you and Sharmila are in the same cat lovers group and Sharmila likes a Page that sells scarves, we might suggest the scarves Page to you.</li><li class="x">If you’ve recently engaged with a certain topic on Facebook, we might then suggest other posts that are related to that topic. So if you recently liked or commented on a post from a basketball Page, we could suggest other posts about basketball.</li><li class="x">You might see posts based on where you are and what people near you are interacting with on Facebook.
