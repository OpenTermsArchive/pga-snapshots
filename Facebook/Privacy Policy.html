Then we can take action to prevent it.</p><h3 class="bv n">Safety and integrity</h3><p class="w">For example, if someone without an account joins a room and shares a harmful video, we can take action according to our Community Standards. We can remove content that violates our terms and policies, or share information with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of death or imminent bodily harm.</p><h3 class="bv n">Performance</h3><p class="w">For example, we collect information when people use our Products, even if they don’t have an account, to measure how fast our pages load in different countries and whether they're working properly.

So if you recently liked or commented on a post from a basketball Page, we could suggest other posts about basketball.</li><li class="y">You might see posts based on where you are and what people near you are interacting with on Facebook.

For example, you may see potential ads because you match the age range and interest category. We determine which ones to show you based on things like whether it best achieves the advertiser’s goal and is most relevant to you. To do this, we use algorithms and machine learning to order the ads we may show you. We use different factors such as the ad quality, the advertiser's desired audience and budget. We also consider how likely we think it is that you will react to the ad based on things like your activity on Meta Products. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/447278887528796" target="_blank">Learn more</a>.</li><li class="y"><strong>All of this information helps us show you the most relevant ads.</strong> When you see an ad on Meta Products (e.g. in your Facebook Feed), we use this process to choose the most relevant ad to show you.</li></ul></div><div class="bh"><div class="bi" id="annotation-84">84</div><h2 class="bj n">How we promote safety, security and integrity</h2><p class="w">We share your information with law enforcement, government authorities, Meta Companies and other third parties (including industry peers) when we have a good faith belief it’s necessary to detect, prevent and address a variety of situations, such as:</p><ul class="x"><li class="y">Unauthorized use of our Products. <a href="#annotation-85" target="_self">See an example.<sup>[85]</sup></a></li><li class="y">Violations of our terms and policies. <a href="#annotation-86" target="_self">See an example.<sup>[86]</sup></a></li><li class="y">Investigating suspicious activity</li><li class="y">Protecting ourselves, including our rights, property, personnel or Products</li><li class="y">Preventing abuse, fraud, or other harmful or illegal activity, on and off our Products</li><li class="y">Protecting you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries</li><li class="y">Emergency situations, such as risk of death or imminent bodily harm</li></ul></div><div class="bh"><div class="bi" id="annotation-85">85</div><h2 class="bj n">Unauthorized use of our Products</h2><p class="w">For example, if you unlawfully collect and use Facebook user data, we may share your information to defend ourselves against claims or in litigation.</p></div><div class="bh"><div class="bi" id="annotation-86">86</div><h2 class="bj n">Violations of our terms and policies</h2><p class="w">For example, if you post threatening or harmful content, we may share your information across the Meta Companies to protect ourselves and others.
