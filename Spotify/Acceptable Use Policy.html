<p>We may update these User Guidelines and the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/platform-rules/plain/">Platform Rules</a> from time to time - you can find the latest version on our website.</p>
<p>Violating the User Guidelines or <a href="https://www.spotify.com/platform-rules/plain/">Platform Rules</a> may result in removal of any content or material you've contributed to the Services and/or termination or suspension of your account.
