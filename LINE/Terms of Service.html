<p><span>10.6. Users shall retain their rights to their Submitted Contents, and LINE shall not acquire </span>　<span>any such rights; provided, however, that, among the Submitted Contents, for those made available to other Users generally (i.e., not just to the User's &ldquo;friends&rdquo;), the User who posted such Submitted Contents shall be deemed to have granted LINE a worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license (including the right to amend (such as abbreviating) such Contents to the extent LINE deems necessary and appropriate, and the right to sublicense such usage rights to other third parties working together with LINE), to use such Contents for services and/or promotional purposes.</span></p>
<p><span>10.7. Users shall not exercise their rights such as author&rsquo;s moral rights with respect to the Submitted Contents in relation to the use by LINE or a third party under Articles 10.5 and 10.6 above.</span></p>

<p><span>10.9. If LINE believes that a User has violated or may violate any applicable laws or regulations or the provisions of these Terms and Conditions in relation to the Submitted Contents, or when otherwise reasonably necessary for LINE&rsquo;s business, then LINE reserves the right to preclude such User's use of the Services in certain manners, such as deleting the Submitted Contents without providing prior notice to the User.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>11. Coins</span></b></p>
<p><span>11.1. Coins will be provided to Users by the means specified by LINE, such as purchases in the Services, special offers and the like. The purchase unit, method of payment, and any other terms and conditions for granting the Coins will be determined by LINE and indicated in the Services or on LINE&rsquo;s website.</span></p>
<p><span>11.2. Coins may not be exchanged or used for cash, property or other economic gain other than the services and Contents designated by LINE. The number of Coins required for receiving the services or Contents, as well as other terms for the exchange of Coins, will be determined by LINE and indicated in the Services or on LINE&rsquo;s website.</span></p>
<p><span>11.3. Coins may only be used by the account that obtained the same. Furthermore, Coins provided by terminal devices of different operating systems may not be carried over or combined, even if they are under the same name, since the types of Coins are different.</span></p>
<p><span>11.4. Coins will not be refunded for any reason whatsoever; provided, however, that this shall not apply if necessary under applicable laws and regulations. In such case, LINE shall determine the process for refunds in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations, and such information will be made available on LINE's website, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>12. Provision of Subscription Services</span></b></p>
<p><span>12.1.

<p><span>12.2. Users may take procedures for the cancellation of Subscription Services at any time; provided, however, that even if a User takes the procedures for cancellation prior to the intended period of use, the User may not change such period of use, nor may the User cancel the purchase of the Subscription Services. In such case, the fees already paid will not be refunded, nor will there be any refund on a pro rata basis. However, the foregoing will not apply if laws or regulations require otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span>12.3. If a User does not complete their cancellation procedure by the designated date and time, the period of use of the Subscription Services may be automatically renewed in accordance with the terms prescribed by LINE even after the end of the period of use of such Subscription Services.</span></p>
