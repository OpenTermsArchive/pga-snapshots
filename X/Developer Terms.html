<p> </p>
<p><b>VII. Term; Subscription Fees; Payment; Suspension, and Termination. </b></p>
<p><b>A. Term. </b>The term of this Agreement will start on the date (i) you accept the terms herein or (ii) start accessing or using any of the Licensed Material, whichever is earlier, and will continue until you stop accessing and using the Licensed Material unless terminated earlier as described below.</p>
<p><b>B. Subscription Terms. </b>Paid Services provided as part of the Licensed Material are made available as a recurring subscription service that provides access to certain features, benefits, or services, as described on the Developer Site and the Payment Portal. If you purchase a Paid Service, you do so by paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis in accordance with the payment terms set forth below. When you subscribe to access the Paid Service(s) via the Payment Portal, you expressly agree that you are authorizing recurring payments and that payments will be made by the payment method you have selected until the applicable Paid Service is canceled by you or by X or this Agreement is otherwise terminated. Your subscription to the Paid Service will automatically renew monthly until canceled in accordance with this Agreement. Your payment information will be automatically processed by the Payment Processor (as defined below) at the start of each subscription period applicable to the Paid Service(s). If your payment information is declined, your subscription may be canceled until you provide new payment information for the applicable Paid Service(s). If you provide new payment information and your payment account is successfully charged, your new subscription period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date the successful charge took place. Prices for Paid Services are subject to change from time to time. X will provide reasonable advance notice of any material change to the price of Paid Services, which notice may be provided via the Developer Site. For subscription fees, price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. If you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by canceling your subscription to the applicable Paid Service(s) prior to the price change going into effect.</p>
<p><b>C. Payment Terms. </b>X may offer payment options that vary by Paid Service, device, operating system, geographic location, or other factors, which may be updated from time to time. These payment options may include web payments using a third party payment processor (“<b>Payment Processor</b>”). When you access a Paid Service, you agree: (i) to pay the price listed for the Paid Service, along with any additional amounts relating to applicable taxes, surcharges, credit card fees, bank fees, foreign transaction fees, foreign exchange fees, and currency fluctuations, on a recurring basis during the applicable subscription period; and (ii) to abide by any applicable terms of service, privacy policies, or other legal agreements or restrictions (including additional age restrictions) imposed by the Payment Processor in connection with your use of a given payment method. The subscription fee will automatically be applied at the start of the renewal period for the applicable subscription period unless you cancel the Paid Service(s) on the Developer Site. It is your responsibility to make sure your banking, credit card, debit card, and/or other payment information is up to date, complete, and accurate at all times. If you make a payment for a Paid Service through a Payment Processor, X may receive information about your transaction such as when it was made, when a subscription is set to expire or auto- renew, what platform you made the purchase on, and other information. X will not be liable for any errors made or delays by the Payment Processor, your bank, your credit card company, or any payment network. All payments to X are non-refundable except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or as required by law.</p>
<p><b>D.</b> <b>Taxes and fees.</b> All fees exclude any and all taxes and similar fees now in force, enacted, or imposed in the future on the transaction, delivery of the Licensed Material, or the delivery of the X Content including any sales, use or value added taxes, goods and services tax, consumption tax, customs duties, tariffs, or similar charges. These taxes may include but are not limited to, VAT, GST, sales tax, withholding tax, and any other applicable taxes but exclude taxes solely based on X’s net income. You are responsible for the payment of all such taxes, duties, and charges and any related penalties and interest arising from the payment of such amounts. In addition, a surcharge may be charged to recover costs associated with Digital Services Tax (&#34;DST&#34;) or similar jurisdiction-specific taxes or regulatory fees incurred by X in certain jurisdictions. This surcharge will appear as a separate line item on your invoice, where applicable, and will be calculated as a percentage of applicable charges as determined by X in its sole discretion. X may adjust this surcharge at any time, without prior notice, in response to increased tax or fee rates or related administrative costs. Depending on your location, X may be responsible for collecting and reporting information related to transaction taxes arising from your purchase of Paid Services. You grant X permission to provide your account and personal information to relevant tax authorities to fulfill our tax collection and reporting obligations. </p>
<p><b>E. Canceling Your Subscription for Paid Services.</b> Your subscription for Paid Services will automatically renew monthly unless you cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before the end of your current subscription period. There are no refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods, including in a situation where certain features, benefits, and/or services are modified or discontinued. SUBSCRIPTION PLANS ARE PREPAID, NON-REFUNDABLE (UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW), AND AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AT THE END OF EACH SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD UNLESS THE SUBSCRIPTION IS CANCELED FOLLOWING THE CANCELLATION PROCEDURES HEREIN. You may cancel your subscription for Paid Services at any time via the Developer Site and you will no longer have access to the Paid Services (or any features or functionality thereof) at the end of your then-current subscription term. When you cancel the Paid Services, your subscription will remain active from the time you cancel until the end of your current subscription period. You will not receive a refund or credit for any remaining days in your current subscription period unless required by law. All payments for Paid Services are final and not refundable or exchangeable except as required by applicable law. X makes no guarantee as to the nature, quality, or value of a Paid Service or the availability or supply thereof. Refunds or credits are not provided for any unused or partially used Paid Service (for example, a partially used subscription period). <b>All transactions are final</b> unless you have a right to withdraw pursuant to law, such as provided below<b>. </b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;"><b>1. Withdrawal Right &amp; Refunds for Users Living in EU or UK. </b>When you purchase any Paid Services on subscription, you expressly agree to do so on a subscription basis and that the subscription will commence immediately on your date of purchase. If you are a consumer in an EU Member State or the UK, you agree you have fourteen (14) days after your purchase to withdraw from your contract for purchase for any reason. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;"><b>2. No Withdrawal Right for Users Living in Taiwan. </b>When you purchase Paid Services, you do so on a subscription basis, the subscription will commence immediately on your date of purchase, and the Paid Service is fully performed once started. If you are a consumer in Taiwan, you agree that you can cancel your subscription for any Paid Services in accordance with Section VII.E above, but that there is otherwise no right to rescind your subscription and no refund will be issued.</p>
<p><b>F. Paid Services Are Non-Transferable between X Accounts. </b>Each purchase of a Paid Service applies to a single X account, meaning that your purchase will apply solely to the account you were using when you purchased the Paid Service and will not apply to other accounts that you may have access to or control over. If you have or control multiple accounts and you want access to Paid Services on each account, you must purchase the Paid Service on each account individually. You may not allow others to use your X account to access any Licensed Material that such person did not order. You may not purchase a Paid Service or use any Licensed Material if you are a person with whom U.S. persons are not permitted to have dealings pursuant to economic sanctions, including, without limitation, sanctions administered by the United States Department of the Treasury&#39;s Office of Foreign Assets Control or any other applicable sanctions authority (&#34;<b>Prohibited Person</b>&#34;). This includes, without limitation, persons located in, a citizen of, or ordinarily resident in the following countries and regions: Cuba, Iran, the Crimea Region of Ukraine, North Korea and Syria. You represent and warrant that you are not a Prohibited Person.</p>
<p><b>G. Restrictions and Obligations. </b>You may only purchase and use a Paid Service or use the Licensed Material if you are legally allowed to use the Licensed Material in your country and you live in a country supported by X for the applicable Paid Service or Licensed Material. X may, in its discretion, restrict the ability to access the Licensed Material or purchase a Paid Service in certain countries. X reserves the right to modify the list of supported countries from time to time. X reserves the right to refuse Paid Services transactions or to cancel or discontinue the sale or use of a Paid Service or the use of any Licensed Material in its sole discretion. </p>
<p><b>H. Suspension. </b>X may suspend your use of and access to the Licensed Material immediately without notice (a) if X reasonably believes that (i) your use of the Licensed Material would cause damage to, or an inordinate burden upon, the Licensed Material, (ii) you have violated this Agreement, (iii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for X, (iv) X’s provision of the Licensed Material to you is no longer commercially viable; (b) for prolonged inactivity; (c) if X is requested or directed to do so by any competent court of law, regulatory authority, or law enforcement agency; or (d) for failure to pay for the Paid Services. X will not be liable for damages of any sort that result from any such suspension.</p>
<p><b>I. Termination.</b> X may terminate this Agreement for any reason at X’s sole discretion. Except where such early termination is the result of your breach of this Agreement, such early termination by X shall be effective at the end of the then-current subscription period. If you violate the terms of this Agreement, X may terminate this Agreement for cause immediately upon notice to you and you will not receive a prorated refund for any Paid Services. You may cancel your subscription for the Paid Services or your use of the Licensed Material on the Developer Site. Upon termination of this Agreement: (a) all licenses granted in this Agreement immediately expire and you must cease use of any Licensed Material; and (b) you shall permanently delete all Licensed Material in all forms and types of media, and copies thereof, in your possession. Upon the request of X for any reason, you will promptly (and in any event within ten (10) business days of such request) provide evidence (e.g., screenshots of deletion confirmation) of compliance with the provisions of the aforementioned subpart (b) of this Section. The parties to this Agreement will not be liable to each other for any damages resulting solely from termination of this Agreement as permitted under this Agreement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>VIII. Compliance Audit.</b></p>
<p>X or a mutually agreed upon third party agent subject to obligations of confidentiality will be entitled to inspect and audit any records related to the performance of this Agreement in your control or possession upon reasonable notice to you, and at a reasonable time during normal business hours, for the purpose of verifying compliance with this Agreement and the fees payable to X for the two (2) year period preceding the audit. X may exercise its audit right no more than once every twelve (12) months unless it has reasonable cause for noncompliance, and such audit shall not unreasonably interfere with your business activities. You will provide your full cooperation and assistance with such audit and provide access to all Licensed Material in your possession, applicable agreements, and records. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as part of the audit, X may request, and you agree to provide, a written report, signed by an authorized representative, listing your then-current deployment of the Licensed Material. You will pay X within thirty (30) business days after the completion of the audit the amount of any underpayment revealed by any such audit. In addition, if any such audit reveals an underpayment by you of five percent (5%) or more, then you will also reimburse X for the reasonable costs and expenses of such audit. The requirements of this Section will survive for one (1) year following the termination of this Agreement.</p>

If X seeks indemnification or defense from you under this Section, X will promptly notify you in writing of the claim(s) brought against X for which it seeks indemnification or defense. X may assume full control of the defense of claims with legal counsel of its choice.

<p> </p>
<p><b>XI. Limitation of Liability.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;"><b>1. Choice of Law and Forum Selection.</b> To the extent permitted by law, all disputes related to this Agreement, including any disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the marketing of the Licensed Material, and/or your participation in the Licensed Material, will be brought exclusively before a competent court in Ireland without regard to conflict of law provisions and will be governed by Irish law, notwithstanding any agreement between the parties to the contrary. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, in its sole discretion, X may bring any claim, cause of action, or dispute it has against you in any competent court in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction and venue over the claim.<br />
<br />
<b>2. YOU HAVE ONE YEAR TO BRING A CLAIM AGAINST X.</b> You must bring any claim against X arising out of or related to this Agreement within one (1) year after the date of the occurrence of the event or facts giving rise to the dispute unless applicable law provides that the normal statute of limitations for that claim may not be shortened by agreement. If you do not bring a claim within this period, you forever waive the right to pursue any claim or cause of action, of any kind or character, based on such events or facts, and such claims or causes of action are permanently banned, and X will have no liability with respect to such claim.<br />
<br />
<b>3. Class Action Waiver. </b>To the extent permitted by law, you also waive the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, collective action, or representative action proceeding.<br />
<br />
<b>4. Changes to this Section. </b>This Dispute Resolution section survives the end of the relationship between you and X, including cancellation of or unsubscribing from any services or communications provided by X.<br />
<br />
<b>5. Injunctive Relief. </b>Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that money damages would be an inadequate remedy for X in the event of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement protecting X&#39;s intellectual property or Confidential Information, and that in the event of such a breach or threat, X, in addition to any other remedies to which it is entitled (including money damages), is entitled to such preliminary or injunctive relief (including an order prohibiting you from taking actions in breach of such provisions), without the need for posting bond, and specific performance as may be appropriate. The parties agree that neither the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods nor the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act shall apply to this Agreement regardless of the states in which the parties do business or are incorporated. No waiver by X of any covenant or right under this Agreement will be effective unless memorialized in a writing authorized by X.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>XIV. Miscellaneous.</b></p>
<p><b>A. Assignment. </b>You shall not assign any of the rights or obligations granted hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, contract, merger (whether you are the surviving or disappearing entity), stock or asset sale, consolidation, dissolution, through government action, or otherwise, except with the prior written consent of X. X is authorized to sign modifications and consents for X Internet Unlimited Company, an Irish company responsible for the information of X users who live outside the United States. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section will be null and void and X may terminate this Agreement.</p>
<p><b>B. User Protection. </b>Unless explicitly approved by X in writing, you shall not use, or knowingly display, distribute, or otherwise make X Content, or information derived from X Content, available for purpose of: (a) conducting or providing surveillance or gathering intelligence, including but not limited to investigating or tracking X users or X Content; (b) conducting or providing analysis or research for any unlawful or discriminatory purpose or in a manner that would be inconsistent with X users&#39; reasonable expectations of privacy; (c) monitoring sensitive events (including but not limited to protests, rallies, or community organizing meetings); or (d) targeting, segmenting, or profiling individuals based on sensitive personal information, including their health (e.g., pregnancy), negative financial status or condition, political affiliation or beliefs, racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical affiliation or beliefs, sex life or sexual orientation, trade union membership, X Content relating to any alleged or actual commission of a crime, or any other sensitive categories of personal information prohibited by law.</p>
<p><b>C. Government Use. </b>If you display, distribute, or otherwise make available any X Content to Users that are, or that act on behalf of, any government-related entity (each a <b>“Government End User”</b>); (a) you must apply for (or already subscribe to) an Enterprise plan (as described at <a href="https://developer.x.com/en" rel="nofollow">developer.x.com/en</a>); (b) you shall identify all such Government End Users when submitting your use case for review to X; and (c) you shall thereafter notify X in writing of any new Government End Users or any new use cases with existing Government End Users before the Services display, distribute, or otherwise make available any X Content to a Government End User or for any new use case. X may prohibit you from making X Content available to any Government End User. You shall not use, or knowingly display, distribute, or otherwise make X Content, or information derived from X Content, available to any Government End User whose primary function or mission includes conducting surveillance or gathering intelligence.

If you use the X API or X Content in your official capacity as an employee or representative of a U.S. state or local government entity and you are legally unable to accept the indemnity, jurisdiction, venue, or other clauses herein, then those clauses do not apply to such entity to the extent required by law.

<p><b>G. Entire Agreement. </b>This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties regarding the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all other agreements between the parties related to the subject matter, whether written or oral. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of law to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in effect. No waiver under this Agreement will be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the party granting the waiver. A waiver granted on one occasion will not operate as a waiver on other occasions. This Agreement does not create or imply any partnership, agency or joint venture.</p>
