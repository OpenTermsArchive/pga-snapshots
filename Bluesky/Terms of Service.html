Limitation of Liability</h2><p><em>Summary: Bluesky isn’t responsible for any problems caused by other people’s posts or third-party claims. If something goes wrong, Bluesky’s responsibility is limited to $100—unless Bluesky did something really bad, like broke the law or acted on purpose to hurt someone.</em></p><ol><li><p><u>Excluded Damages.</u> To the fullest extent permitted by law, and except for claims covered under the Exceptions to Exclusion below,<!-- --> <strong>Bluesky and its affiliates will not be liable for</strong>:</p><ol><li><p>Indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages—such as lost profits, business interruption, or loss of data;</p></li><li><p>Costs for substitute services;</p></li><li><p>Any third-party claims, including those arising from User Content.</p></li></ol><p><strong>All third-party claims are expressly excluded from Bluesky&#x27;s liability</strong>, regardless of cause or theory of liability.</p></li><li><p><u>Exceptions to Exclusion.</u> The exclusions in this Section do not apply to claims of death or personal injury based on:</p><ol><li><p>Bluesky&#x27;s fraud or criminal misconduct;</p></li><li><p>Gross negligence or willful misconduct by Bluesky;</p></li><li><p>Violations of statutory rights that cannot be contractually disclaimed under applicable law.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><u>Monetary Cap.</u> Except for claims falling within the Exceptions to Exclusion, Bluesky&#x27;s total cumulative liability for all claims arising out of or related to these Terms—whether in contract, tort, statute, or otherwise—is limited to one hundred U.S. dollars (US$100).</p></li><li><p><u>Scope &amp; Legal Validity.</u> These limitations apply to the maximum extent allowed by law. If any jurisdiction limits or prohibits certain exclusions or limitations, those exclusions or limitations will apply to the extent allowed, and the remainder of this Section will remain enforceable.</p></li></ol><h2 id="governing-law">13. Governing Law, Jurisdiction, Venue, Dispute Resolution, and Arbitration</h2><p><em>Summary: If there&#x27;s a problem, email us and we&#x27;ll try to fix it. If that doesn&#x27;t work, most issues have to go to private arbitration, not court—unless it&#x27;s about a safety issue like an injury. You can&#x27;t join a group lawsuit against Bluesky unless we say it&#x27;s okay. These rules still apply if you delete your account.</em></p><ol><li><p><u>Governing Law and Jurisdiction.</u> These Terms and any disputes or claims arising out of or relating to them (including non-contractual disputes) are governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p></li><li><p><u>Jurisdiction and Venue.</u> Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, any legal action that is not subject to arbitration must be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Delaware. You and Bluesky consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in those courts and waive any objections based on forum or convenience.</p></li><li><p><u>Mandatory Local Law Exception.</u> If you reside in a jurisdiction that requires the application of its own local laws, courts, or other mandatory procedures for non-arbitral disputes—such as Brazil—then those mandatory provisions will apply instead of the Delaware governing law and venue provisions in this Section, but only to the extent required by applicable law.</p></li><li><p><u>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.</u></p><ol><li><p><strong>Informal Resolution.</strong> Most disputes can be resolved informally. If you have an issue with the services, you agree to contact us first and allow us at least 60 days to resolve the dispute before initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. You can do this by contacting us at<a href="mailto:support@bsky.app">support@bsky.app</a>. In order for your informal resolution request to be valid and for us to respond, you must provide us with: your name, your email address, a statement that you are invoking the pre-arbitration informal dispute resolution process, the jurisdiction where you live (city and state, province, or county), your account handle, the specific amount of damages and/or other relief you are seeking, all supporting evidence in your possession that will help us resolve the dispute, links to or descriptions of the location of any evidence you know of but do not possess that will help us resolve the dispute, and whether you intend to pursue arbitration if we cannot resolve your dispute informally and, if so, what your claim will be in arbitration.</p><p>You agree that after you submit your informal resolution request, you will participate with us via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to resolve the dispute informally. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference, but we will have a company representative fully participate in the conference.</p><p>The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process required by this paragraph. You agree that participating in the informal dispute resolution process described in this paragraph is a necessary pre-condition to filing an arbitration demand.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mandatory, Mutual Arbitration of Disputes.</strong> <!-- -->If the Informal Resolution process listed above does not resolve your dispute, you agree that, subject only to the below carve-out and to the maximum extent permitted by local laws, you will resolve any dispute, disagreement, or claim relating to these Terms through final and binding arbitration by AAA (U.S.) or ICDR (UK/EU), seated in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we agree to a different location. Both parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement. Each party shall select one arbitrator; the pair appoint a third.</p><p>The AAA Rules are available at<!-- --> <a href="https://www.adr.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.adr.org</a> <!-- -->or by calling 1-800-778-7879. To start arbitration, submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to Bluesky as specified in the AAA Rules.</p><p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. If we prevail in arbitration we&#x27;ll pay all of our attorneys&#x27; fees and costs and won&#x27;t seek to recover them from you, unless the arbitrator determines your claims were frivolous. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys&#x27; fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.</p></li><li><p><strong>Carve-Out for Safety Claims.</strong> Arbitration does not apply to claims that fraud, criminal misconduct, or gross negligence by Bluesky caused death or personal injury. Those matters may be brought in court or arbitration, at the claimant&#x27;s choice, subject to these Terms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Waiver of Class Actions.</strong> TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND BLUESKY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF, CLASS MEMBER, OR REPRESENTATIVE IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p><p>If any part of this Waiver of Representative Actions is found to be unenforceable, Section 13.D (&quot;Dispute Resolution and Arbitration&quot;) shall be deemed void in its entirety.</p><p>Nothing in this section shall prohibit the AAA&#x27;s consolidation of the administration of multiple claims pursuant to the AAA Rules.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bluesky&#x27;s Discretion to Consolidate.</strong> <!-- -->Notwithstanding the foregoing waiver, Bluesky may, at its sole discretion, elect to consolidate multiple arbitrations involving similar issues or claimants into a single consolidated arbitration or class-arbitration-like proceeding. Any such consolidation will occur only under the applicable AAA rules.</p></li><li><p><strong>Small Claims and Injunctive Relief.</strong> This clause, &quot;Dispute Resolution and Arbitration,&quot; does not restrict you from bringing eligible claims in small claims court. It also does not waive your statutory rights under the law of your country of residence.</p><p>To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim in arbitration and seek public injunctive relief (injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><u>Survival</u>.
